# The Calc Book

## Description

Textbooks are expensive and overwritten, and that's stupid. Here's why:

1) We shouldn't lock knowledge behind a paywall. Especially if you're already paying to go to university.

2) Professors will assign textbooks and often simply use the them as secondary materials or even just for problems. Why spend $300 on a book when your professor could easily just take a picture of the problems he wants you to solve?

3) There is often far too much extraneous information on a subject. I believe they should be concise and clear on exactly what information they propose

For these reasons, I am creating the first of possibly multiple free to use textbooks. This one in particular is on Calculus. I'll probably make second calculus book with more advanced topics, following my university's Calc I, II, and III. I'll probably make a set of Physics books as well as they are very related.

To access the book, go to the file "[poor-mans-calculus.md](poor-mans-calculus.md)" in the repo. I hope this work is useful to you. Feel free to use it for anything or even contribute to the works

## About the Author

I study Electrical Engineering (minored in Software Engineering) at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and am set to graduate in the Spring. There I played football and bass in the Jazz Band.

I'd describe myself as a maker, spending my free time building electronics, wrtiting software, writing music and poetry, creating conlangs, etc.

I personally believe that by receiving a strong understanding of limits, derivatives, and integrals as *concepts* that anyone with a base knowledge of algebraic problem solving can easily learn calculus.

Here's a picture of me:

Though I have longer hair now, just not any new pictures!
