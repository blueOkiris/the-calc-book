# Poor Man's Calculus

## What this is

This document should represent a complete understanding of calculus necessary for Rose-Hulman's MA111 class as some course syllabuses are found online and I can use them for reference.

The document will begin with a review of pre-calc and move into the realm of calculus concepts. I'll then explain derivatives and integrals, and provide an avenue for practicing these concepts
